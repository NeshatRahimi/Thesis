# Thesis
climate change forecasting 

It consistas of 5 main sections:

    model1 data Qazvinabdehi to svr
    model 2 input main station SVR
    LSTM algorithm with exogenous variables model1 data Qazvinabdehi GCM to GCM 
    LSTM algorithm with exogenous variables model2 data Qazvinabdehi main station
    chert o pert
    
and 3 subsections:

    model 1 preprocessing input data  havashenasi abdehi & mr rezaee data run once only for making excel file
    model 2 preprocessing input data havashenasi abdehi & mr mirzaee data run once only for making excel file
    adbedi timeseries LSTM algorithm 
    
and they are titled with # and the exact wordings above.

the subsections aren't recommended to be checked as they are mostly file maker,and the "chert o pert" section neither :)
